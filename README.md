## Syllabus
### Module 1: Hello notebook
This week you will learn how to start a new Python analysis project and introduce you to pandas and the Jupyter Notebook. You will use them to draft an elementary data analysis that is clear and reproducible.

### Module 2: Hello data
This week you will download a list of campaign contributors published by the California Civic Data Coalition and load it into a Jupyter Notebook for analysis with pandas. This class will cover:

* Learning how the money funding campaigns is tracked in the United States
* Downloading campaign data from the California Civic Data Coalition website
* Importing structured data files as a DataFrame with pandas’ read_csv method
* Inspecting DataFrames with pandas’ info and head methods
* Inspecting and summarizing DataFrame columns with pandas’ value_counts and describe and sum methods

### Module 3: Hello analysis
This week you will learn how to use pandas to conduct a data analysis and document your work with the Jupyter Notebook. It will cover:

* Filtering a DataFrame with pandas’ indexing system
* Merging two DataFrames with pandas’ merge method
* Sorting a DataFrame with pandas’ sort_values method
* Aggregating a DataFrame with pandas’ groupby method
* Using these tools to responsibly navigate and analyze California campaign data

### Module 4: Hello Internet
This week you will learn how to log changes to your Jupyter Notebook with version-control software and publish your analysis on the Internet. It will cover:

* The git version control software and its integration with GitHub’s social network
* How data journalists use GitHub and Jupyter Notebook to publish their work
* How to use the Markdown markup language to annotate a Jupyter Notebook
* How to create a new git code repository and start tracking code
* How to connect the repository to GitHub and publish a Jupyter Notebook
